### Software to control your digital life

We're creating software infrastructure to put users back in control of their 
digital lives. 

The internet has become such a huge part of our daily lives to the extent 
that it's difficult to imagine a world without information and connectivity 
(literally) at your fingertips.  Collaboration is easier, communication 
simpler and generally work is more productive.  However, we've also made 
sacrifices in order to achieve these gains, in many cases without fully 
comprehending the risks.

By adopting large centralised services we've answered the 
[call of the siren servers](#TODO) and made an implicit trade. That we 
will share our habits and data with them in exchange for something useful. 
In doing so we've empowered internet behemoths while simultaneously reducing 
our ability to influence them.  We risk becoming slaves to the current 
system unless we can create alternatives that compete.  It's time to work on 
those alternatives.

### Tools to build a distributed future

Our approach is to create secure, robust and *open-source* infrastructure 
that others can build on.  Security and privacy need to be incorporated from 
the ground up so that promises of "your data is safe with us" can be kept by 
the technology itself.  In some cases, this means taking existing tools and 
technologies and making them much easier to use and deploy.  In other cases, 
it may mean rebuilding tools and creating new products to replace those that 
are no longer fit for purpose. 

We are starting with mechanisms to provide identity and connectivity for 
your personal cloud of devices as well as the mechanisms to keep data in 
sync across them.  You can find more detail about those on our 
[software](../software/) page and get involved in the 
[developer mailing-list](http://lists.nymote.org) too.  If you prefer to only hear about announcements, then please sign up to our [public list](TODO).
