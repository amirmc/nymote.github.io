This is a holding area that contains links to longer form content. It's a 
mixture of our own work as well as things we find interesting around the web.
I'll be organising these and summarising them as I go through them.  I may  
merge this into the [interesting links][] page instead of keeping it separate
.

If you know of something I should add here, please do 
[send me an email][amir-email], 
[create an issue on GitHub][issue] or
submit a pull request to the [repository][]!
