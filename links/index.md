This is a collection of links to news articles, products and discussions 
which I found interesting and will write more about in due course.  The 
items are bookmarked and tagged on Pinboard and the best way to view and 
filter those tags is directly on the **[Pinboard site][pinboard]**.  

If you use a feed reader, you can also subscribe to an **[RSS feed][feed]** 
of the links below which will update whenever I add new content.  

If you find something I should add to this collection, please do 
[send me an email][amir-email]!
