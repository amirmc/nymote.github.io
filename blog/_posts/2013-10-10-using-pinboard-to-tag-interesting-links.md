For some time now, I've been collecting links to news articles, products and 
discussions relating to the Internet of Things, Personal Clouds, data 
privacy/ownership and products.  This is a rapidly growing list and there 
are nearly 200 bookmarks already.  Trying to sift through them to find 
something specific is getting difficult and it must be even more difficult 
for anyone else trying to browse the collection.

## Organising a collection of bookmarks

After looking around and asking people about social bookmarking sites, I was 
pointed to [Pinboard][] (*thanks, [Ulrich][]!*). This is a simple and 
efficient site that helps you to gather links, tag and comment on them and, 
in my case, make them publicly accessible.  A few days ago I imported all my 
Nymote bookmarks into Pinboard and have been testing it out since then.  
I've been extremely happy with how it works and it's dramatically improved 
the workflow for getting the links onto this site.  

The bookmarklet I added to my browser makes it simple to add new links with 
descriptions and the ability to add links by email has been extremely useful 
when browsing from my phone.  Pinboard also has the ability to generate RSS 
feeds so I've been able to take that feed from Pinboard and completely 
reorganise the **[Nymote links page][links]**.  It now presents a reverse 
chronological list of all the links so far, together with brief summaries of 
the content.  In order to filter and browse the tags, you'll need to visit 
my [Pinboard page][nymote-pinboard] and I'll be going back over the older 
links to add more descriptions.  To stay completely up to date with the 
things I find online, you can even subscribe to my 
[nymote-links feed][links-feed] directly.  If you come across something 
you'd like me to add, please do [send me an email][amir-email]!

### Subscribe to the blog via news feeds

In addition to the above changes, I've also added links on the website to 
enable people to [subscribe to the blog][atom-feed] using feed readers.  A 
news feed was always available if you knew the URL (or found it in the 
[source code][site-repo] of the site) but there are now more prominent 
subscribe links on the blog pages. Along with the [mailing list][], this 
gives people even more options to keep up with news about Nymote.
