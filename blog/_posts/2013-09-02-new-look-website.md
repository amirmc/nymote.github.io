**Nymote** is a set of tools and software [infrastructure][], created from the ground up, to provide end-users with life-long control of their networked personal data.  Think of it as the [tool stack][] to enable a personal, decentralised Internet.   This site brings together all the core open-source technology we're building and describes what we're working towards.  Infrastructure that allows us to create decentralised products and services.

## Infrastructure matters

The Internet has become such a huge part of our daily lives to the extent that it’s difficult to imagine a world without information and connectivity (literally) at your fingertips. Collaboration is easier, communication simpler and generally work is more productive. However, we’ve also made sacrifices in order to achieve these gains, in many cases without fully comprehending the risks.

By adopting large centralised services we’ve made an implicit trade that in exchange for something useful, we will share our habits and data with them. In doing so we’ve empowered Internet behemoths while simultaneously reducing our ability to influence them. We risk becoming slaves to the current system unless we can create alternatives that compete. Just as the current incarnation of the Internet is built on a range of open-source technologies, we need a set of robust tools that allow the developers of the future to build distributed systems and services that empower users.  

Our approach is to create secure, robust and open-source infrastructure that others can build on. Security and privacy need to be incorporated from the ground up so that promises of “your data is safe with us” can be kept by the technology itself, rather than ever-changing Terms of Service. In some cases, this means taking existing tools and technologies and making them much easier to use and deploy. In other cases, it means rebuilding tools and creating new products to replace those that are no longer fit for purpose.

## Open-source building blocks

We're starting with fundamental [infrastructure][] to solve the problems around [operating systems][Mirage] for the future, [identity][Signpost] for users and devices and [data-persistence][Irminsule] across those devices.

**[Mirage][]** takes a clean-slate approach to the *operating system*, with a view to whole-system optimisation and use on embedded devices.  **[Signpost][]** deals with the growing problems around *identity* and returns the *end-to-end principle* of connectivity to our devices.  **[Irminsule][]** rethinks how we *persist data* based on the principles of Git and solves the problems of provenance and sync. 

A lot of [cutting edge work][papers] has been done on the components above by [many contributors][about].  The emerging tools form the bedrock on which anyone can build robust and scalable applications.  Applications that provide all the great things we're used to but without requiring us to be subject to the whims of the Internet Barons.  You can read more about each of these projects by following the links above and this site will be updated as they progress.

<!--One of the fundamental limitations is that distributed systems are difficult and in order to build viable alternatives, we need to address the underlying problems first.

Building viable alternatives means revisiting our assumptions and thinking over the problems that need to be solved in the context of the Internet today.  
It’s time to work on those alternatives. -->
