                <p>It's been just over a week since FOSDEM ended and it was even more hectic
than we imagined.  Thousands of open source developers across dozens of
rooms and speakers and lots of delicious waffles.  I'm still in awe that
this is a completely volunteer organised event and that everything appeared
to run smoothly.  Especially, since this has to be the <em>only</em> conference
I've been at where the wifi was usable (and ubiquitous).</p>

<p>The most interesting aspect was how crowded some of the rooms became and how
quickly.  For example, the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/track/configuration_management/">configuration management track</a> was
pretty much full throughout the day with a crowd of people trying to get in.
I heard that the Mozilla track was equally busy as were some other devrooms.
This may be in indication of relative popularity but also the sheer scale
that this annual event has reached. It may be outgrowing ULB.  Thankfully,
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2014/news/2014-02-03-videos/">videos will be available</a> this year so I hope I can catchup
up with the sessions I couldn't get to!  One that I was particularly
interested in is the <a href="http://www.xenproject.org/developers/teams/arm-hypervisor.html">Xen/ARM</a> talk in the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/track/automotive_development/">Automotive track</a>.
Since cars are now getting smarter and Xen works on embedded devices it
would be an excellent use case for Mirage to ensure that the software
running in vehicles is safe and does only what it's supposed to.  There were
many other Xen talks too and you catchup with them on the
<a href="http://blog.xen.org/index.php/2014/02/07/xen-fosdem14-an-even-report/">Xen blog</a>.</p>

<p>The Mail track talks were crowded and during the
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/track/mail/">postfix talk</a> we were treated to an interesting review of
spam around the globe, which was followed up by the Mailpile team announcing
their <a href="https://www.mailpile.is/blog/2014-01-31_Alpha_Release_Shipping_Bits_and_Atoms.html">alpha release</a> on stage! The
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/track/internet_of_things/">Internet of Things devroom</a> had a number of interesting talks
but there need to be more people thinking about the underlying
infrastructure needs before we can begin building resilient, decentralised
networks.</p>

<p>For the Mirage talk, Mort and Anil gave a great demo by building unikernels
on stage to show the process in action.  They continued the demos at the Xen
stall to a number of people including some surprisingly young FOSDEM
attendees.  We'll soon be moving our personal websites to become self-hosted
unikernels, and from there we can build out more of the Nymote toolstack.</p>

<p>We've captured some of the interesting tweets and pictures below and
hopefully next year we'll be speaking at FOSDEM about how we're using the
Nymote toolstack.</p>

                <p>We're heading to <a href="https://fosdem.org/2014/">FOSDEM</a> in a few days!  If you haven't heard of FOSDEM
before, it's a two-day, volunteer-organised event to promote open source
software.  It takes place in Brussels and there will be over 500 talks,
across 44 tracks attended by around 5000 people. The numbers alone don't
capture the scale of the event so click though the image below for a view of
the schedule -- and that's just for the Saturday. Did I mention this is all
run by volunteers?</p>

<p><a href="https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/day/saturday/"><img src="http://nymote.org/images/fosdem-sat.jpg" alt="FOSDEM on Saturday" /></a></p>

<p>We'll be meeting a bunch of like-minded people in the various sessions and
talking more about how the Nymote stack is progressing, especially as Mirage
is gaining momentum after the <a href="http://nymote.org/blog/2014/announcing-first-mirage-release/">1.0 release</a>.  Anil and Mort
will be giving a talk about Mirage on Sunday at 1pm (<a href="https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/event/mirageos/">details</a>)
and also giving demos at the Xen Booth from 2:30pm-4:30pm (in Building K on
the 1st floor).  Since deployment to embedded systems is also important,
we're interested in open source efforts on ARM devices like the
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/event/arm_allwinner_sunxi_socs/">Allwinner SoC community</a> -- especially since Anil has been hacking
on <a href="http://www.xenproject.org/developers/teams/arm-hypervisor.html">Xen/ARM</a> on a cubieboard. There are a number of other Xen-related
talks and you can find out more from the <a href="http://blog.xen.org/index.php/2014/01/10/xen-related-talks-fosdem-2014/">Xen blog</a>.</p>

<p>Given the use-cases for Nymote, there are some obvious places you can expect
to find us.  On Saturday there's the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/track/mail/">Mail track</a>, where we'll
be discussing existing tools and catching up up with the Mailpile guys, who
we last <a href="http://nymote.org/blog/2013/indiewebcamp-uk/">met at IndieWebCamp</a>.  On the Sunday, there's the
<a href="https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/track/internet_of_things/">Internet of Things dev-room</a>, where we'll bring up the upcoming
problems we see regarding centralised IoT services and how Nymote will
change this.  In addition, a colleague from the lab, <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jra40/">Jon Anderson</a>,
is speaking about security and the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/capsicum/">Capscium project</a>, which is
relevant for sandboxing security (<a href="https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/event/capiscum/">details</a>).</p>

<p>We'll be writing up our experiences shortly after we return and in the
meantime, the real issue will be deciding which sessions to go to.  If
you're in Brussels for that weekend do get in touch with us!  We love to
meet people working towards the same goals.</p>

                <h4 class="title-description"></h4>
                <p>We're very pleased to announce that version 1.0 of Mirage, the first of the
components, has been released! This is the first major release of Mirage and
represents many years of development, testing and community building. As
mentioned previously, there are three main components of the
<a href="http://nymote.org/blog/2013/introducing-nymote/">Nymote toolstack</a>, which are: <a href="http://nymote.org/software/mirage/">Mirage</a> - an
operating system for the cloud, <a href="http://nymote.org/software/signpost/">Signpost</a> - an identity and
connectivity system and <a href="http://nymote.org/software/irminsule/">Irminsule</a> - a distributed database. As
always, the best way to learn is to try things out, so follow the revamped
<a href="http://openmirage.org/wiki/install">install instructions</a> and create your own webserver to host
a static website!</p>

<p>We've written before <a href="http://nymote.org/blog/2013/overview-of-mirage/">about Mirage and its importance</a> and this
1.0 release represents the first stable toolkit for creating appliances.
One of the first places where we'll be using Mirage is this (and other)
websites.  We will take all the content you see on this site and compile it,
along with the required components from a operating system (e.g networking
and a file system) together with webserver functionality and create a small,
fully-functioning appliance.  We'll then run that appliance directly on top
of the Xen hypervisor on the public cloud.  The <a href="http://openmirage.org">Mirage website</a>
has been running this way for some time and that unikernel appliance is
around 1MB in size (including all content).
To make it easier for others to generate sites this way we've been creating
<a href="http://openmirage.org/blog/decks-n-drums">new tools</a> that help with static site generation.  As the
appliances are so small, we're even able to check them into version control
systems so you can easily roll-back to a previous version without having to
recompile anything! You can see the
<a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www-deployment">repository of previous unikernels</a> to get an idea of this
in action.</p>

<p>The Mirage team will also be using the new tools to convert their personal
websites into unikernel appliances and as we create and release more
libraries we'll be incorporating those also.  For example, once we have a
workflow with unikernel websites it becomes much easier to add other
functionality because it's a simple matter of using the appropriate
libraries, writing some application code and then deploying to the cloud.
In other words, you begin to reap the benefits of having a operating system
that works for you in the cloud, while ensuring it remains lean and safe.
For example, we could incorporate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CardDAV%E2%80%8E">CardDAV</a> and then use our own
infrastructure to synchronise contacts between our mobile devices, instead
of relying on third-parties to do it for us.  As this process becomes more
streamlined, it's easy to see how we can build up to having our own personal
cloud by incorporating only the features we need, when we need them and
always under our control.</p>

<p>There have been a number of articles about Mirage, and a good introduction
to the concept and direction is in the recent Communications of the ACM
article called
<a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2566628">Unikernels: Rise of the Virtual Library Operating System</a>.
There are also write ups about the Mirage release at <a href="http://www.eweek.com/cloud/xen-project-builds-its-own-cloud-os-mirage.html/">eWeek</a>, <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/t/operating-systems/xen-mirage-the-less-more-cloud-os-233823">InfoWorld</a>
and a general overview on <a href="http://www.linux.com/news/enterprise/cloud-computing/751156-are-cloud-operating-systems-the-next-big-thing">Linux.com</a> (a full list is
on the self-hosted <a href="http://openmirage.org/links">Mirage website</a>).  We're looking
forward to the upcoming activities for 2014 and the new avenues that Mirage
will open up for us!</p>

                <p>This year has been an interesting one for proponents of decentralisation,
privacy and open protocols.  We've had revelations about
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files">mass-surveillance</a> by Governments, a number of open source
projects, who want to put the user back in control (<a href="https://www.mailpile.is">Mailpile</a>, <a href="https://arkos.io">arkOS</a>,
<a href="http://darkmail.info">Dark Mail Alliance</a> and many others), as well as efforts to
bring more of these projects to light (e.g. <a href="http://redecentralize.org">redecentralize</a>). We also
have a number of exciting new research initiatives to work on the technology
problems of decentralisation (e.g <a href="http://usercentricnetworking.eu]">User Centric Networking</a>). Overall,
2014 promises to be an exciting year of new software releases and increasing
momentum for such projects.</p>

<p>From our point of view we'll be having some imminent software releases,
which will make significant advances to safely hosting your own content in a
manner that is secure, economical and scalable. This will be the beginning
of the move to a personal cloud and we'll start by moving our personal
websites (as well as this one) onto a self-hosting platform.  This platform
will be something to build on and experiment with over the rest of the year,
replacing parts of the third-party infrastructure we use today. In the
meantime, we wish you a great holiday season and look forward to the New
Year!</p>

                <h4 class="title-description"></h4>
                <p>As our devices grow smarter and more connected it's reasonable to expect
that we'll get better services and features as a result.  One such device
that's already making its way into our homes is the humble TV.  We already
have smart devices that <em>connect</em> to our TVs, such as the AppleTV and
Google's Chromecast device, but the manufacturers themselves are also adding
more functionality.  However, what these devices are doing is worth a second
look.</p>

<p>A recent post by <a href="http://doctorbeet.blogspot.co.uk">DoctorBeet</a>, examines what his LG TV was doing when he
noticed advertising on the homescreen.  This led him to discover that LG was
offering a Smart Ad service to advertisers, based on customers' data.  The
LG site has since been taken down but apparently <em>"LG Smart Ad analyses
users favourite programs, online behaviour, search keywords and other
information to offer relevant ads to target audiences."</em> Furthermore, there
was a setting on the TV itself called "Collection of watching info", where
the default setting was 'ON'.  All of this seems quite invasive, since the
TV was purchased outright so it's not a case of trading privacy for
something that's free.  You'd think that turning the collection setting to
'OFF' would largely solve the issue but this story isn't that simple.  You
should <a href="http://doctorbeet.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/lg-smart-tvs-logging-usb-filenames-and.html">read the post in full</a>, but a brief summary is below.</p>

<p>DocterBeet turned off the collection setting and then decided to examine his
internet traffic.  Apparently the viewing data was being <em>regardless</em> of the
setting on the TV, which completely breaks user expectations.  As if that
wasn't bad enough, the TV was scanning external USB drives and sending back
that data too.  Sometimes just the filenames but sometimes all the content
too.  When LG was contacted about the problems, their response was baffling.
Essentially, they claimed that DoctorBeet had <em>"accepted the Terms and
Conditions on [their] TV"</em> and implied there was nothing they could do.
Since DoctorBeet is a technically savvy customer, he created rules on his
home router to prevent any further connections to LG's computers, while
ensuring he could still get the software updates.</p>

<p>This case highlights a potential trend where devices that we've paid for are
still attempting to collect user-data for the purpose of advertising.  A
case of you are <em>both</em> the customer <em>and</em> the product. What's equally
concerning is that one technically able customer was able to understand what
was going on but the majority of users would have been none-the-wiser.</p>

<p>The next few years are going to be interesting as more news like this breaks
and people become more aware of how desperate companies are to learn about
their users.  The irony is that if the customers had a real voice, many of
them may be willing to trade with the companies and provide them access to
data-sets, assuming a safe and secure way to do so was available.  We're
working on a platform as part of the <a href="http://hubofallthings.wordpress.com">Hub of all Things</a> project, where
companies and customers can do exactly this.  There may be other users who
want to have more control over their home networks so we're also looking at
<a href="http://homenetworks.ac.uk">novel ways to allow people to interact and configure home routers</a>.</p>

<p>The Internet of Things and connected devices have the potential to be as
ground-breaking as the Web but end-users must also be empowered if we are to
reap all the benefits.</p>
