Unikernel: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nymote/nymote.github.io.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nymote/nymote.github.io)

Website pages for [Nymote](http://nymote.org)

This site aims to pull together the different projects and showcase the 
overall direction we're taking.  That of creating open infrastructure and 
tools to allow developers to build decentralised services for end-users.

There are many active repositories as part of this work and they can be 
found at:

* Mirage - https://github.com/mirage (see also [openmirage.org](http://openmirage.org))
* Signpost - https://github.com/signposts

Occasionally, repos will be forked into https://github.com/nymote as 
pointers to look elsewhere for code.  We have a lot of repos lying around so 
it's sometimes difficult to navigate :)
