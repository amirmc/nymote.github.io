    <h3>Mail</h3>
    <p>
      One of the most fundamental and ubiquitous tools we have is email.  In 
      order to completely own your digital presence, we must first be able 
      to easily manage and control our own email communications. At the 
      moment, it's simply too difficult for an individual to run their own 
      email server but there's no reason it can't be simplified. With email 
      servers that work for small groups, like families or friends, we can 
      begin to see routes to new email innovation, where developers can 
      write software that interacts directly with the server to enhance 
      email in ways we cannot right now.

    <h3>Contacts</h3>
    <p>
      Our address books have the potential to be the ultimate social network.The data contained within is so valuable that services clamour for 
      access to it, sometimes even 
      <a href="blog/2012/friend-recommendations-and-address-book-privacy/">taking it without your knowledge</a>. 
      It's unfortunate that the that only innovation the humble address book 
      has seen is via third parties who want to gain control of it and put 
      ads in front of you.  An alternative would be to re-imagine your 
      personal address book and make it the core of your online social 
      interactions.  This way, we can incorporate your private data to 
      enhance other services without losing ownership.

    <h3>Calendar</h3>
    <p>
      Our diaries are the often overlooked part of the trio yet many of us 
      would be lost without proper device synchronisation.  This only 
      becomes more complex the more devices we have and the more we interact 
      with others.  Party invites coming in via social networks and meetings 
      being organised via work all need to find their way to one place, 
      while occasionally letting your partner know when you're likely to be 
      free.  Many services have attempted to solve specific pieces of these 
      problems but it's the integration with your Mail, Contacts and other 
      services which will unleash more productivity.
