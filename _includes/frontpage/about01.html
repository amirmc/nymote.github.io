    Building lightweight, secure and highly scalable systems, specifically geared to live on the cloud is not a trivial undertaking. Even though itâ€™s possible to string together something quick with existing tools, they're ultimately limited since they lack the necessary security considerations. To build resilient and distributed systems of this kind requires deep expertise in the areas of networking, distributed software and the cloud.
